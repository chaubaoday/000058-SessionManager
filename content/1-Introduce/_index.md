**AWS Lambda**
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without managing servers. It is widely used for handling short tasks, such as data processing, API calls, or managing events.

Advantages of using AWS Lambda:

- No server management: AWS automatically handles resource allocation and scaling.
- Event-driven execution: Runs code in response to events, such as HTTP requests (when integrated with API Gateway) or changes in DynamoDB data.
- 
Pay-as-you-go: You only pay for the execution time and number of requests.

Application in CRUD API:
Lambda handles specific API functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.

**Amazon DynamoDB**
DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database by AWS, designed for applications requiring high performance and scalable solutions.

Advantages of using Amazon DynamoDB:

- High performance: Optimized to handle millions of requests per second with low latency.
- No infrastructure management: DynamoDB automatically scales and backs up data.
- Seamless integration: Works efficiently with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and other AWS services.

Application in CRUD API:
DynamoDB serves as the application's data store. You perform create, read, update, and delete operations on data stored in DynamoDB tables.

**AWS API Gateway**
API Gateway is an AWS service that enables you to create, deploy, and manage RESTful or WebSocket APIs.

Advantages of using API Gateway:

- Seamless integration with Lambda: Easily connects API Gateway with AWS Lambda to process requests.
- Security: Supports API key management, rate limiting, and authentication (IAM, Lambda Authorizer).
- Multi-protocol support: Includes REST, HTTP, and WebSocket.

Application in CRUD API:
API Gateway acts as the entry point for the API, receiving HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and routing them to the appropriate Lambda functions for processing.

**CRUD API Workflow Summary**

- The user sends an HTTP request to API Gateway.
- API Gateway forwards the request to the corresponding Lambda function.
- Lambda handles the logic and interacts with DynamoDB to perform operations on the data.
- Lambda returns the result via API Gateway, which is sent back to the user.

This system is not only flexible but also cost-efficient due to its pay-as-you-go resource model.
